Just Tic-Tac-Toe if you get bored. This doesn't use any external libraries that are super-required. jQuery is in there, but I don't use it at the moment.

Currently making: Dark mode. I finished the logic and it's working. I'm making the Dark mode and I'll have it be a (sort-of) permanent change. It'll stay in the dark mode (if you don't open a different file) and it'll work. I'll work on that for a few minutes as it's not a whole lot to rig up.

Upon playing using the project with a friend, I discovered that I needed to make more logic for it you create a tie. I'll make that and fix the "bot" part of the game.
