Just Tic-Tac-Toe if you get bored. This doesn't use any external libraries that are super required. jQuery is in there, but I don't use it at the moment.

Currently making: Logic if you get 3-in-a-row. Basically, the logic you need if you win. I'll make a score keeper that will keep track if you trigger a function. However, it will only be known if you look through the code or read this (you can be told, but that's no fun).
